## Justin Chen's Personal Website

I created this with the intent of using it as a secondary resume/portfolio and for me to learn and practice web development/design. Once I master it a bit more, I plan on adding JavaScript into this site as well.

Currently, some of the pages and sections are still a work in progress and I will slowly add more of my work.
