## Justin Chen's Personal Website

[Site](https://jyhchen.github.io/)

I created this with the intent of using it as a secondary resume/portfolio and for me to learn and practice web development/design. Once I master it a bit more, I plan on adding JavaScript into this site as well.

Pages and sections are still a work in progress
